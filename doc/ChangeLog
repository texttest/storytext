Version 0.1:

    - initial release

Version 0.2:

    - refactoring of API to base all state-based widgets on focus (keyboard and mouse) rather than on things like
      "changed" signals. Particularly the TreeSelection code is simpler now and easier to use: all "set programatically"
      methods removed as there is no need to tell the script engine this any more.
    - added option '-delay' for allowing a pause between replaying each action, useful if somebody is trying to see what
      happens in the GUI.

Version 1.0:
    - Support added for monitoring external processes started by the system under test, both recording their termination
	and simulating any updates to files they may have made at the time. 
    - Fixed deprecated items in newer versions of PyGTK
    - 'Keyboard mnemonic accelerators' created for the GUI shortcuts produced for PyGTK GUIs
    - Various refactorings

Version 1.1:
    - Made handling of programmatic changes simpler and easier to manage. Most widgets with state
      are handled via the focus which is easier to manage and less prone to occasional error.
    - Prevented programmatic changes of page in gtk.Notebook (via the set_current_page method) from being recorded.
    - Shortcut bar no longer crashes if you press start and stop with no action in between.

Version 1.2:
    - Decided the focus was a flaky way to handle programmatic change. Now done by method interception
      which is foolproof so long as we remember to intercept all the appropriate methods.
    - removed hack for deleting windows. Introduced a new one instead which should work better on
      the more recent versions of PyGTK. Now manually calls all the listeners and then calls window.destroy(). 
    - New RadioGroupIndexer to aid recording/replaying radio buttons
    - Nothing is recorded on widgets with the visible property set to False.
    - gtk.TreeSelection management overhauled. Should work better when used actively: i.e. when things
      are triggered by selecting rows rather than just getting the selection when doing other things.
    - Application can now decide how to create gtk.Notebook widgets, rather than PyUseCase deciding for it
    - Can now monitor expanding and collapsing of gtk.TreeView rows.
    - Can now monitor toggling of gtk.CellRendererToggle widgets
    - Can now handle usage of gtk.TreeModelFilter in gtk.TreeView widgets
    - Time delay on application events performed in correct thread, race condition fixed
    - Application events recorded as a single wait when there are several in different categories, rather
      than as several individual waits.
    - Re-work to reuse the process code from TextTest rather assume an interface. New module process.py created.

Version 1.3:
------------
Generic module (usecase.py):
    - Slimmed down process.py module a lot as most of it is rendered unnecessary by Python 2.4's subprocess module.
      Now concentrate on handling "job processes" i.e. a process and its children, so that they can be found and killed
      if needed. Module renamed "jobprocess.py" accordingly.
    - Fixed bug that didn't allow the same application event to be repeated at a later date
    - Fixed timing bug when files are edited and processes killed : don't replay in the wrong order...
    - Now record process termination before application events as the former can trigger the latter
PyGTK module (gtkusecase.py):
    - support added for handling FileChoosers (both the _OPEN and _SAVE varieties)
      This is complex as a lot of things seem to happen asynchronously on Windows and PyGTK's access to 
      the widget internals of FileChoosers is a bit incomplete.
    - various tweaks to gtk.TreeSelection handling to make it more robust
    - Fixed bug so that nested programmatic changes work properly

Version 1.4:
------------
Generic module (usecase.py):
    - Allow application event renaming. Sometimes identifiers change in the system, and it's necessary to
      tell PyUseCase about this so it can update any application events that are thereby discovered to have
      already happened (with the old name).
PyGTK module (gtkusecase.py):
    - TreeModelIndexer for handling tree views internalised and simplified, 
      now do everything via a single "monitor" call and don't need to create TreeModelIndexers externally,
      or have application-specific code to identify rows uniquely
    - new method registerCellToggleButton, this isn't handled via "connect" any more and should work better.
    - PaneDragEvent improved. Should work for gtk.Paned instances that set the shrink property to False also.
    - TreeSelectionEvent removed noImplies parameter. Unclear what it was used for.

Version 1.4.1:
--------------
Generic module (usecase.py):
    - Bugfixes to improve determinism around application events, making sure the wait occurs in a predictable place.
      Looks ahead to avoid creating threads or idle handlers which will only end up waiting anyway.
    - Bugfixes for process termination on Windows. This now requires Python 2.5 to work correctly. 

Version 1.4.2:
--------------
Process-handling module (jobprocess.py):
    - Restored code to kill arbitrary processes, not just subprocesses, on Windows. New interface.

Version 2.0:
-----------
New module (gtklogger.py)
    - A completely new aspect to PyUseCase, which can now produce you a standard log
      of everything that happens in your GUI, which should serve as a baselin for e.g. TextTest.
Generic module (usecase.py)
    - New "supercede" category for application events, allowing them to override more than one
      category without overriding them all.
    - Application event logging when replaying happens just before proceeding, for determinism
    - Fixed bug where recording a shortcut missed the last action
    - dropped log4py and externally received loggers, now use logging module
    - Handles Python 2.6 without deprecation warnings
    - Signal recording made more robust, doesn't require something else to happen before it comes into effect (!)
    - Bug fix where rollback failed if the next command was a wait.
PyGTK module (gtkusecase.py)
    - Lowered priority of replay idle handler. Means all the timing hacks could be removed.
    - Handle programmatic changes in filechoosers via set_filename
    - new monitorSignal method, so that using PyUseCase can involve only adding code rather than editing it
	
Version 3.0:
-----------
Radical new approach (gtkusecase.py)
    - No longer requires any instrumentation in your code for GUI testing.
	"UI map" stored in a separate file. See website. Instrumentation still works
	and auto-generates you a new UI map, after which you can delete it.
	Can now operate from the command-line entirely outside your code, run "pyusecase".
Generic module (usecase.py)
    - applicationEvent and applicationEventRename are now module-level functions and basically are the API.
    - Removed "process termination monitoring", "file edit monitoring" and "stdin recording" functionality
	In the first two cases there are better ways in TextTest. In the last it was deemed not useful.
    - Fixed crash on receiving SIGINT if application has no handler for it.
    - Fixed bug where timeDelay on application event only used if the event hadn't already occurred.
PyGTK record/playback module (gtkusecase.py)
    - Widget handling support / improvement
	gtk.ComboBox selections, entirely new
	gtk.CellRendererText user edits, entirely new
	gtk.Widget right clicks (previously only handled on gtk.TreeView)
	gtk.CheckMenuItem and gtk.CellRendererToggle work like gtk.ToggleButton now
	  (Basically separate names for enabling and disabling)
    - Programmatic change handling improvements :
	TreeView selections caused indirectly by collapsing rows are no longer recorded
    - New script (pyusecase -s) to list the supported widgets
    - Slow motion replay doesn't freeze the GUI any more (works with timeouts rather than sleeps)
    - createShortcutBar now module-level function and basically is the API (barring back-compatibility)
    - Automatic handling of application calling stop_emission method in a handler.
	(Prevent it from disabling recording). Does not yet handle returning False.
    - Now automatically handle application calling gtk.events_pending
	Basically preventing a hang because of PyUseCase's idle handler causing it to always return True.
    - Better error handling for gtk.TreeView events
PyGTK Auto-logging (gtklogger/*)
    - Widget description support / improvement
	gtk.CellView entirely new
	gtk.ToggleButton redone
	gtk.HButtonBox now logged horizontally like gtk.HBox
	gtk.TreeView works also when the data is not in the gtk.TreeModel but is found via set_cell_data_func
	gtk.Menu only gets described when it is visible, like everything else
	gtk.TextView description no longer discards leading whitespace
	gtk.Image :
	  states file name if created with gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file
	  states XPM and a number if created with gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_xpm_data
	  can be given a name in the code via image.set_data("name", "My Image")
    - Widget update description support / improvement
	gtk.Window now describes changes of title
    - Ordering of visibility/sensitivity change descriptions now sorted
	(doesn't depend on order of object creation in the app)

Version 3.0.1:
-------------
Enhancement/bugfix:
    - Now automatically update the UI map file appropriately when a widget is named
Bug fixes:
    - Auto-logging now ignores tooltip windows, preventing sporadic description of them when system is loaded
    - Fixed stacktrace from logging gtk.EntryCompletion windows
    - Check Python version >= 2.4
    - Show help on no args instead of stacktrace
    - Update the correct UI map file when there are several and one already has a matching section
