Version 0.1:

    - initial release

Version 0.2:

    - refactoring of API to base all state-based widgets on focus (keyboard and mouse) rather than on things like
      "changed" signals. Particularly the TreeSelection code is simpler now and easier to use: all "set programatically"
      methods removed as there is no need to tell the script engine this any more.
    - added option '-delay' for allowing a pause between replaying each action, useful if somebody is trying to see what
      happens in the GUI.

Version 1.0:
    - Support added for monitoring external processes started by the system under test, both recording their termination
	and simulating any updates to files they may have made at the time. 
    - Fixed deprecated items in newer versions of PyGTK
    - 'Keyboard mnemonic accelerators' created for the GUI shortcuts produced for PyGTK GUIs
    - Various refactorings

Version 1.1:
    - Made handling of programmatic changes simpler and easier to manage. Most widgets with state
      are handled via the focus which is easier to manage and less prone to occasional error.
    - Prevented programmatic changes of page in gtk.Notebook (via the set_current_page method) from being recorded.
    - Shortcut bar no longer crashes if you press start and stop with no action in between.

Version 1.2:
    - Decided the focus was a flaky way to handle programmatic change. Now done by method interception
      which is foolproof so long as we remember to intercept all the appropriate methods.
    - removed hack for deleting windows. Introduced a new one instead which should work better on
      the more recent versions of PyGTK. Now manually calls all the listeners and then calls window.destroy(). 
    - New RadioGroupIndexer to aid recording/replaying radio buttons
    - Nothing is recorded on widgets with the visible property set to False.
    - gtk.TreeSelection management overhauled. Should work better when used actively: i.e. when things
      are triggered by selecting rows rather than just getting the selection when doing other things.
    - Application can now decide how to create gtk.Notebook widgets, rather than PyUseCase deciding for it
    - Can now monitor expanding and collapsing of gtk.TreeView rows.
    - Can now monitor toggling of gtk.CellRendererToggle widgets
    - Can now handle usage of gtk.TreeModelFilter in gtk.TreeView widgets
    - Time delay on application events performed in correct thread, race condition fixed
    - Application events recorded as a single wait when there are several in different categories, rather
      than as several individual waits.
    - Re-work to reuse the process code from TextTest rather assume an interface. New module process.py created.

Version 1.3:
------------
Generic module (usecase.py):
    - Slimmed down process.py module a lot as most of it is rendered unnecessary by Python 2.4's subprocess module.
      Now concentrate on handling "job processes" i.e. a process and its children, so that they can be found and killed
      if needed. Module renamed "jobprocess.py" accordingly.
    - Fixed bug that didn't allow the same application event to be repeated at a later date
    - Fixed timing bug when files are edited and processes killed : don't replay in the wrong order...
    - Now record process termination before application events as the former can trigger the latter
PyGTK module (gtkusecase.py):
    - support added for handling FileChoosers (both the _OPEN and _SAVE varieties)
      This is complex as a lot of things seem to happen asynchronously on Windows and PyGTK's access to 
      the widget internals of FileChoosers is a bit incomplete.
    - various tweaks to gtk.TreeSelection handling to make it more robust
    - Fixed bug so that nested programmatic changes work properly

Version 1.4:
------------
Generic module (usecase.py):
    - Allow application event renaming. Sometimes identifiers change in the system, and it's necessary to
      tell PyUseCase about this so it can update any application events that are thereby discovered to have
      already happened (with the old name).
PyGTK module (gtkusecase.py):
    - TreeModelIndexer for handling tree views internalised and simplified, 
      now do everything via a single "monitor" call and don't need to create TreeModelIndexers externally,
      or have application-specific code to identify rows uniquely
    - new method registerCellToggleButton, this isn't handled via "connect" any more and should work better.
    - PaneDragEvent improved. Should work for gtk.Paned instances that set the shrink property to False also.
    - TreeSelectionEvent removed noImplies parameter. Unclear what it was used for.

Version 1.4.1:
--------------
Generic module (usecase.py):
    - Bugfixes to improve determinism around application events, making sure the wait occurs in a predictable place.
      Looks ahead to avoid creating threads or idle handlers which will only end up waiting anyway.
    - Bugfixes for process termination on Windows. This now requires Python 2.5 to work correctly. 

Version 1.4.2:
--------------
Process-handling module (jobprocess.py):
    - Restored code to kill arbitrary processes, not just subprocesses, on Windows. New interface.

Version 2.0:
-----------
New module (gtklogger.py)
    - A completely new aspect to PyUseCase, which can now produce you a standard log
      of everything that happens in your GUI, which should serve as a baselin for e.g. TextTest.
Generic module (usecase.py)
    - New "supercede" category for application events, allowing them to override more than one
      category without overriding them all.
    - Application event logging when replaying happens just before proceeding, for determinism
    - Fixed bug where recording a shortcut missed the last action
    - dropped log4py and externally received loggers, now use logging module
    - Handles Python 2.6 without deprecation warnings
    - Signal recording made more robust, doesn't require something else to happen before it comes into effect (!)
    - Bug fix where rollback failed if the next command was a wait.
PyGTK module (gtkusecase.py)
    - Lowered priority of replay idle handler. Means all the timing hacks could be removed.
    - Handle programmatic changes in filechoosers via set_filename
    - new monitorSignal method, so that using PyUseCase can involve only adding code rather than editing it
	
Version 3.0:
-----------
Radical new approach (gtkusecase.py)
    - No longer requires any instrumentation in your code for GUI testing.
	"UI map" stored in a separate file. See website. Instrumentation still works
	and auto-generates you a new UI map, after which you can delete it.
	Can now operate from the command-line entirely outside your code, run "pyusecase".
Generic module (usecase.py)
    - applicationEvent and applicationEventRename are now module-level functions and basically are the API.
    - Removed "process termination monitoring", "file edit monitoring" and "stdin recording" functionality
	In the first two cases there are better ways in TextTest. In the last it was deemed not useful.
    - Fixed crash on receiving SIGINT if application has no handler for it.
    - Fixed bug where timeDelay on application event only used if the event hadn't already occurred.
PyGTK record/playback module (gtkusecase.py)
    - Widget handling support / improvement
	gtk.ComboBox selections, entirely new
	gtk.CellRendererText user edits, entirely new
	gtk.Widget right clicks (previously only handled on gtk.TreeView)
	gtk.CheckMenuItem and gtk.CellRendererToggle work like gtk.ToggleButton now
	  (Basically separate names for enabling and disabling)
    - Programmatic change handling improvements :
	TreeView selections caused indirectly by collapsing rows are no longer recorded
    - New script (pyusecase -s) to list the supported widgets
    - Slow motion replay doesn't freeze the GUI any more (works with timeouts rather than sleeps)
    - createShortcutBar now module-level function and basically is the API (barring back-compatibility)
    - Automatic handling of application calling stop_emission method in a handler.
	(Prevent it from disabling recording). Does not yet handle returning False.
    - Now automatically handle application calling gtk.events_pending
	Basically preventing a hang because of PyUseCase's idle handler causing it to always return True.
    - Better error handling for gtk.TreeView events
PyGTK Auto-logging (gtklogger/*)
    - Widget description support / improvement
	gtk.CellView entirely new
	gtk.ToggleButton redone
	gtk.HButtonBox now logged horizontally like gtk.HBox
	gtk.TreeView works also when the data is not in the gtk.TreeModel but is found via set_cell_data_func
	gtk.Menu only gets described when it is visible, like everything else
	gtk.TextView description no longer discards leading whitespace
	gtk.Image :
	  states file name if created with gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_file
	  states XPM and a number if created with gtk.gdk.pixbuf_new_from_xpm_data
	  can be given a name in the code via image.set_data("name", "My Image")
    - Widget update description support / improvement
	gtk.Window now describes changes of title
    - Ordering of visibility/sensitivity change descriptions now sorted
	(doesn't depend on order of object creation in the app)

Version 3.0.1:
-------------
Enhancement/bugfix:
    - Now automatically update the UI map file appropriately when a widget is named
Bug fixes:
    - Auto-logging now ignores tooltip windows, preventing sporadic description of them when system is loaded
    - Fixed stacktrace from logging gtk.EntryCompletion windows
    - Check Python version >= 2.4
    - Show help on no args instead of stacktrace
    - Update the correct UI map file when there are several and one already has a matching section
    - Don't stacktrace if gtk.TreeView has no model attached
    - Don't stacktrace if gtk.TreeView has non-unique full paths
    - Don't stacktrace if gtk.ComboBox is empty or has no model attached
    - Don't insert shortcuts if additional commands are executed in between their component parts

Version 3.1
-----------
Enhancements:
    - Usecase name entry dialog now shows you a preview of the current usecase as you type
    - Usecase name entry dialog now uses descriptive action names instead of PyGTK signal names
    - Support around gtk.ToggleToolButton and gtk.ToolAction proxies much improved
	(both record/playback and logging)
    - Label widgets for gtk.Frame and gtk.Expander now handled in a generic way
	Will mean the format of the log will probably change for these widgets
    - Logging of gtk.Image much improved
	Support animations, display filenames provided by "set_from_file", find images that are children of buttons
Bug fixes:
    - Workaround for GTK 2.10 bug where updates sent after main loop exited
    - Don't stacktrace if gtk.ProgressBar has no text on it
    - Fix logging bug where the last character of 2-line outputs got moved after the "property descriptions"
    - Don't record a file selection for gtk.FileChooser when the folder is changed to a subdirectory
    - Don't stacktrace when a non-existent file is selected in gtk.FileChooser

Version 3.2
-----------
Tkinter support:
    - Basic Tkinter support added which should suffice for simple applications. Both record/playback and autologging.
	See website for which widgets are supported.
PyGTK Enhancements:
    - gtk.TreeView logging improved
	Now describes foreground colours and font weight, if set
    - Non-stock images present in toolbar items are now logged
    - Additional entries added to gtk.ComboBox and gtk.ComboBoxEntry are now noticed and logged
    - "Name chooser" UI is now a separate process, can be run at any point, not just after initial recording.
    - Programmatic deselection of gtk.TreeView rows caused by hiding a row won't be recorded any more
    - Programmatic change caused by gtk.TreeModelFilter.refilter calls won't be recorded either
Bug fixes:
    - Don't stacktrace logging a gtk.Paned of size zero.
    - Don't rely on widget class names in case the application has its own classes with the same names.
    - Don't assume the application has different gtk.CellRenderers for each gtk.TreeViewColumn any more.
    - Better error handling if invalid path given for record script
    - Now works to clear the default map file with -m ''
    - Don't crash if application installs its own signal handler with signal.SIG_IGN
	
Version 3.2.1
-------------
Bug fixes:
    - Tkinter.Entry handling now deals with non-alphanumeric characters properly
    - Usecase names are now collected properly even if the application exits with an exception 
	(particularly SystemExit is important as it's not really an error)

Version 3.3
-----------
General:
    - Try to support PyGTK 2.16 now
    - Can now configure PyUseCase logging with -L <logconfigfile> via standard Python logging format files
    - Usecase name chooser no longer stacktraces on an explicit local path (-m mapfile)
	
Tkinter Record/Playback:
    - New widgets supported for record/playback:
	Tkinter.Canvas
	Tkinter.Checkbutton
	Tkinter.Listbox
    - Changed from using after_idle to after(0... for replaying
	Otherwise application calls to "after" get blocked
    - Replayer added just before mainloop entered
	Reduces risk of it trying to operate before widgets are visible
    - Many more variants of configuring Buttons and Checkbuttons now picked up correctly
    - Now intercept Tkinter.Toplevel.wait_window so that it does nothing when replaying
	Prevents it from blocking idles and hence replayer. Cannot work out why this method
	is useful anyway, it doesn't appear to achieve anything.
Tkinter Autologging:
    - New widgets supported for autologging only
	Tkinter.LabelFrame
	Tkinter.Menubutton
    - Many more widget updates now picked up
	e.g. Tkinter.Toplevel, changes of title
    - Visible borders on Tkinter.Frame get described
    - Layout description improved where items at the bottom are concerned
    - Autologging now picks up widget state, i.e. whether they are greyed out or not
    - Popup menu submenus now get logged properly
Tkinter bugfixes:
    - Tkinter.Text in a dialog no longer causes stacktraces after the dialog is closed
    - Tkinter.Menu items other than the last one can now be selected (!)
    - Don't post popup menus when replaying on Windows, otherwise replay hangs

PyGTK Record/Playback:
    - New widgets supported for record/playback:
	gtk.TextView (previously only autologging)
    - Introduced convention for indexing TreeViews where the labels stretch across multiple lines 
PyGTK Autologging:
    - New widgets supported for specific autologging:
	gtk.SpinButton (previously logged as a gtk.Entry)
    - gtk.TreeViews which set both foreground and background colour now log both these values 
PyGTK Bugfixes:
    - Don't stack trace on PyGTK 2.16 with gtk.TreeViewColumn with no title
    - gtk.gdk.color_parse no longer causes stacktraces on PyGTK 2.16
    - gtk.MenuItems built by UIManager no longer causes stacktraces on PyGTK 2.16
    - Don't stack trace on gtk.TreeView with no model attached, even if there is a matching entry in the UI map.
    - Window closure now recorded correctly if application close handler hides the window
    - Don't try to monitor combo box popup windows, also if they aren't menus

Version 3.4
-----------
General:
    - Now requires at least Python 2.6 (PyUseCase 3.3 supported back to Python 2.4)
    - New mechanism to plug in support for your own custom widgets
	See the website for more information about this
    - Old instrumentation-based interface from PyUseCase 2.x is now removed
	Anyone still using it will need to use PyUseCase 3.3 to migrate before going to 3.4 or later

General bug fixes:
    - Don't try to record SIGBUS or SIGSEGV : these generally signify internal errors

Basic wxPython support added:
    - Somewhat alpha status right now.
	Supports a handful of widget types: wx.Button, wx.TextCtrl, wx.ListCtrl, wx.Frame.
	Many thanks to Cliff Xuan who is driving this forward.

Tkinter bugfixes:
    - Don't stacktrace if idle handlers get called when application is already destroyed

PyGTK Record/Playback:
    - Now support gtk.Dialog.run directly.
	It's previously been documented as not working and required changing code to avoid calling it.
    - No longer assume that gtk.Dialog response IDs will be the standard ones, i.e. gtk.RESPONSE*
	Should now work with anything as response IDs.
PyGTK Autologging:
    - Now logs when a window is maximized programatically
    - Now lists entry completions shown when text is entered in a gtk.Entry
    - gtk.TreeView description now includes selections, marked by '*'
    - gtk.Label descriptions now include markup, if any.

Version 3.4.1
-------------
General:
    - Support restored for Python 2.5 (otherwise it wasn't usable under either Maemo or Jython, both of which are becoming interesting)

Internal:
    - Tidied up everything to be under a single "usecase" package and added to PyPI
	Means "createShortcutBar" should be called from this module instead of "gtkusecase".
    - Migrated from ndict to ordereddict which is part of Python 2.7

Proof of concept support for hildon widget set added:
    - GUI platform based on GTK and used on Nokia's Maemo platform for smartphones.
	Not much more than a proof of concept and a basis to build on. Currently supports
	hildon.AppMenu, hildon.EditToolbar, hildon.GtkTreeView and hildon.CheckButton.

PyGTK bugfixes:
    - Fixed autologging bug in gtk.TreeView when updating information created through data_func interfaces
    - Fixed record/playback bug when using gtk.Dialog.run on dialogs containing widgets with state 
	(e.g. gtk.CheckButton, gtk.Entry)
    - Fixed stacktrace when gtk.Button.get_image() returns something that isn't a gtk.Image
    - Now handle gtk.TreeViews that are set up using insert_column_with* methods
    - Recording / playing back now works when editing multiline text in a gtk.TextView
    - Removed buggy support for recording and playing back dragging of gtk.Paned 
	Was more trouble than it was worth.

wxPython improvements:
    - Basic support for wx.Dialog added (thanks Cliff Xuan)

Version 3.5
-----------
Support for Java GUIs using SWT/Eclipse RCP added.
    - Based on the SWTBot tool. (Thanks to them for a great tool!)
	Regard as Beta status for now. See website for details.

General enhancements:
    - Shortcut functionality now usable in general
	Was previously tied to PyGTK plugin
	GUI is still PyGTK only, but now easy to make your own shortcuts by just editing files. See website for details.

General bugfixes:
    - Various fixes to shortcuts insertion mechanism
    - Correctly handle the situation where several widgets have the same identifier but only one is visible/enabled
    - "Name Chooser" UI now handles encodings other than UTF-8 for unicode.
    - Apostophes in application labels don't screw up the "Name Chooser" UI or the UI map file any more
    - No longer crashes with invalid locale
    - Replayer handles repeated application events in a consistent way with the recorder
    - State change events (e.g. text box edit) in modal dialogs now handled properly

Tkinter bugfixes:
    - No longer fails with non-ASCII text in menu item labels
    - Handle top level windows that are children of other widgets properly

wxPython bugfixes:
    - Prevent occasional spurious output on Windows

Version 3.5.1
-------------

General bugfixes:
    - Source distribution corrected for Python < 2.6 (and hence Jython)
	Will now work to install there using pip or easy_install
    - "Name Chooser" UI now shows arguments also when usecase name has not been chosen yet
    - "Name Chooser" UI now handles encodings other than UTF-8 for unicode (an additional issue fixed)
    - Error message now distinguishes between failing to lookup in UI map file, and failing to find referenced widget

SWT/Eclipse RCP enhancements:
    - Description of empty labels improved
    - Menu items changing state (for example being enabled/disabled) now get noticed and described
    - Can now record and replay changes of "active part" (RCP only)

SWT/Eclipse RCP bugfixes:
    - If the first instruction is "wait for", don't attempt to describe anything before that is done
	Lead to indeterminism
    - Error message instead of stacktrace if SWTBot isn't installed
    - Waiting mechanism around RCP jobs is now more robust, timing more correct
    - Fixed indeterminism in browser describer between "about:blank" and "".

PyGTK bugfixes:
    - Recorder now works on code where dialogs/windows are destroyed from handlers attached to child widgets
    - gtk.Dialog.connect now returns handler IDs, so subsequent disconnect etc operations should work correctly

Version 3.6
-----------
Renamed to StoryText
    - The Py is misleading now we support Java (Swing/Eclipse). Also "UseCase" is a bit too RUP-like.
	Agile talks about Story testing a lot now.
	In any case, any existing test suites will need to:
	  - use TextTest 3.22
	  - rename pyusecase_files to storytext_files
	  - update all references to the new name
	  - TextTest 3.22 will now set STORYTEXT_HOME instead of USECASE_HOME. StoryText alone understands either.

Support for Java Swing GUIs added.
    - Based on RobotFramework's SwingLibrary.
	Regard as Beta status for now. Used on two real GUIs so far. See website for details.

Beginning of support for GEF (extension of SWT) applications.
    - Not production ready for real applications. Next release hopefully will be.

General enhancements:
    - Usecase name chooser gained a Cancel button
	so you aren't forced to enter names if you really don't know what you did
    - Handle application events that happen many times
	We now count the number of times it happens

SWT/Eclipse RCP enhancements:
    - Support for drop-down ToolItems added (i.e. using the drop down menu)
    - Interacting with Text widgets now sets the focus
	Can be important in some contexts
    - Description support added for JFace ControlDecorations

PyGTK enhancements:
    - Support recording of Tree Selections that are disallowed via set_select_function 
	(to test that they ae disallowed...)

General bugfixes:
    - Error messages don't write misleading things about actions with no usecase name entered
    - Use of shortcuts no longer suppresses following application events
    - Reset application events in replayer also when events have already happened
    - When new names are introduced, copy rather than remove old sections in UI map file
	Not all widgets matched by the old section have necessarily been named
    - Handle situation where an application event is triggered in a listener
	Make sure recording happens in the right order
    - Application event printouts should be deterministic now

SWT/Eclipse RCP bugfixes:
    - Custom widget plugin now working for Eclipse RCP
    - Installer bugs under Windows fixed
    - Fixed race condition which led to occasional ClassLoader exceptions finding context menus
    - Job handling more reliable and deterministic
	Less prone to missing events at the start of the usecase
    - Browser description improved
	Now handles HTML text that is set as well as URLs. Also parses HTML tables if they exist.
    - Grid layout descriptions made more compact
	If overlapping the descriptions is possible because of blank cells, it will, which leads to less wide files.

PyGTK bugfixes:
    - TreeSelections programatically changed by set_mode no longer get recorded.
    - Now handles dialogs that existed before StoryText was enabled
	In case it's enabled programmatically


Version 3.7
-----------
Migration:
    - Eclipse RCP applications will need to reinstall the plugin (org.eclipse.swtbot.testscript)

Support for GEF is much more sophisticated and is now in production on one application. Regard as Beta.
    - There is a separate installable plugin for this now, org.eclipse.swtbot.gef.testscript
    - Selection, drag+drop supported

Support for wxPython has moved forward a great deal (Beta) - it now supports (in addition):
    - widgets added "on the fly" (not just ones that were there at the start as before...)
    - wx.Menu (including some support for popups)
    - wx.CheckBox
    - wx.FileDialog
    - wx.StaticText
    - wx.Choice
    - UI map doesn't get fooled by internally generated "names" any more
    - Better layouts in the describer

General enhancements:
    - Application event handling handles many more complicated situations
	Handle application events inside dialogs, interleaved with state-change events, repeated events in categories etc.
	Also time out after 60 seconds instead of hanging forever. Can be configured with "-t" option.
    - Shortcut mechanism now handles arguments
	To start with, uses $ in the file name, and $ inside the file, and matches arguments in order
	See website for more details.
    - If controls aren't present, now wait a while before giving up
	Crude version of application event mechanism for simple situations
    - Usecase name chooser dialog now has scrollbars if needed
    - Maximum output width is now configurable using -M argument.

SWT/Eclipse RCP enhancements:
    - Added support for checkboxes
    - Added support for org.eclipse.ui.forms.ExpandableComposite
    - Added support for typing text into text fields and combo boxes (not just setting text)
    - Can now record/playback pressing Enter in text fields/combo boxes
    - Can now record/playback clicking column headers and editing cells in Tables
    - Now describe popup menu status changes
    - Support "radio toolbar items"
    - Now support RCP's "drop-down toolbar items" (as in the perspective changers in Eclipse)
    - RCP Part activation now uses part title instead of ID (this last might not be unique)
    - Now mostly use image names in describer if these are requested
    - Describe vertical separators differently from horizontal ones

Tkinter enhancements:
    - Grids are now formatted as in the other toolkits, and hence look neater
    - Now works under Python 3
    - Handle row spans in grid layouts

General bugfixes:
    - Can now handle more than one (different) shortcut in the same usecase.
    - Can reuse the same shortcut multiple times also if it ends with an application event.
    - Don't record Text modifications if the value is unchanged
    - Warn if we have duplicated sections in the UI map file (instead of silently ignoring one of them)
    - Produce a nice error if the UI map file can't be parsed
    - Fixed various race conditions in the replayer
    - label finding mechanism is easier to configure (in case your application puts extra labels in between, such as "=")
    - In slow-motion replay, description now printed after the sleep (helps discover missing app events)
    - Eliminated some duplicate description where many things changes state at once
    - Remove race condition when first line of a shortcut is an application event
    - Don't use column-formatting on grids with more than one row, too hard to read

SWT/Eclipse RCP bugfixes:
    - Custom widget plugin now working for Eclipse RCP, also when event types are overridden
    - Workaround for SWTBot with Radio Buttons in Eclipse 3.5
    - Decide job name on scheduling, not on completion, otherwise it can be indeterministic
    - Describer less prone to occasionally describe tooltip windows now
    - Fix stacktrace if horizontal span in grid layout is larger than the number of columns
    - Readonly text fields never record anything
    - Bug fixes for describer laying out HTML tables in Browsers properly
	(e.g. non-breaking spaces and unprintable characters...)

Version 3.8
-----------
Migration:
    - Swing support now requires at least SwingLibrary 1.3
	1.4.1 is now packaged, see below. 1.2 does not work any more.
    - SWT descriptions have changed (same information, different layout). Will need to update TextTest results

The "NameChooser" UI has been generalised and enhanced:
    - Can now be used on any usecase file, not just when entering new names
    - Shows a hierarchical view, including shortcuts and UI map definitions
    - Can be used to create new shortcuts
    - Now the default editor for usecase files in TextTest 3.24

General enhancements:
    - Comments are now preserved between replayed and recorded versions of a usecase
	Useful from TextTest, where they no longer need to be filtered
    - Added a retry loop when widgets are disposed, disabled or invisible in case they become enabled
	Removes the need for some "application events", though not all
    - File polling mechanism added
	Can synchronise on external issues by polling a file and generating an application event if it is created or removed
	See docs for "-f" and "-F"
    - Can now exclude certain widget types from the descriptions
	See docs for "-X"

PyGTK enhancements:
    - Now support GUIs made with gtk.Builder (mostly Dialogs and TreeViews that didn't work before)
    - Stock buttons described as stock buttons. Don't describe images, which are theme-dependent

Swing enhancements:
    - JFileChooser now handled correctly
	(ignore theme-specific names, don't describe the widget itself, describe the FileFilters at the bottom properly)
    - Support for JToggleButton added
    - Unicode support added
    - SwingLibrary now packaged with StoryText and included in the download
	TextTest finds it automatically. Using StoryText alone you still need to add it to the classpath.

SWT/Eclipse RCP/GEF enhancements:
    - Added support for CComboBox
    - Descriptions of updates to MenuBar, ToolBars changed (only print lines that have changed, describe what changed)
